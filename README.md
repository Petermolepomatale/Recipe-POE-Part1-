RecipeApp
RecipeApp is a command-line application written in C# that allows users to manage recipes. Users can enter details for a single recipe, view the recipe, scale the recipe by a factor, reset ingredient quantities to their original values, and clear the recipe to enter a new one. The application runs in memory and does not persist user data between runs.

Features
Enter Recipe Details: Users can enter the details for a recipe, including ingredients and steps.
View Recipe: Users can view the full recipe, including ingredients and steps, in a neat format.
Scale Recipe: Users can scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double), or 3 (triple), and all ingredient quantities are adjusted accordingly.
Reset Quantities: Users can reset the quantities of ingredients to their original values.
